This program requires [npcap](https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.72.exe) to work. Select WinPCap compatibility mode.
If you want to build it urself, I used pyinstaller.
This program does not read, modifies or interacts with the gamefiles in any way. Also does not inject or interact with the game's memory. It uses simple cmd commands and functions to listen, and catch the ip of incoming internet traffic of the game, and displays it's source ip and port.
